/*
1. Implicit Type Conversion
Also called automatic type conversion.

When two different types are used in an expression, C++ automatically converts the "smaller" type to the "larger" type to avoid data loss.

2. Explicit Type Conversion (C-style casting)
You manually force a type change using (type) syntax.

Not recommended in modern C++ because it's less safe and harder to read.

3. Explicit Type Conversion (C++ style â€“ static_cast)
This is the modern, safer and more readable way to convert types in C++.

static_cast tells the compiler exactly what kind of conversion is happening and avoids accidental mistakes.
